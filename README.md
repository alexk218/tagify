## Motivation

As a DJ and obsessive music organizer, I spent _years_ searching for a good music tagging system - with no luck. So I built what I wished existed.
After several months of development and daily use in my own workflow, I'm excited to share Tagify with fellow music lovers who want to take control of their libraries.
