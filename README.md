## Motivation

As a DJ and obsessive music organizer, I spent _years_ searching for a good music tagging system - with no luck.
So I built what I wished existed.
After several months of development and daily use in my own workflow, I'm excited to share Tagify with fellow music lovers who want to take control of their libraries.

## Roadmap

### Full Rekordbox integration

- Export your Tagify ratings and tag data directly to Rekordbox.
- Compare your Spotify playlists with your local Rekordbox collection.
  - Highlights playlist differences and sync opportunities.
  - Auto-downloads high-quality versions of your tagged Spotify tracks, keeping platforms synchronized.
  - Maintain folder organization and playlist hierarchy across platforms.

### Additional tagging functionality

- THE IDEA: Tags become more valuable over time. Allowing you to make connections between tracks you never noticed before.
- A possibility: automatic playlists using pattern recognition.
  - After enough tag data is collected... playlists will be suggested based on some matching criteria.
  - "We found 10 tracks that we think will go well together based on your tags"
- ... still thinking ü§î
